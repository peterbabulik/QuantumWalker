**1. How CA Rules are "Created" (The Wolfram Code):**

You are absolutely correct. Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) rules are defined by a lookup table.
*   There are 2Â³ = 8 possible neighborhood configurations for a cell and its immediate left and right neighbors (e.g., `111`, `110`, `101`, ..., `000`).
*   For each of these 8 configurations, the rule specifies whether the central cell will be `0` or `1` in the next generation.
*   The `rule_number` (from 0 to 255) is simply the decimal representation of an 8-bit binary string. Each bit in this string corresponds to the outcome for one of the 8 neighborhood patterns, typically ordered from `111` (most significant bit) down to `000` (least significant bit).

    | Neighborhood | Bit Position (Wolfram Convention) |
    | :----------- | :-------------------------------- |
    | `111`        | 7 (MSB)                           |
    | `110`        | 6                                 |
    | `101`        | 5                                 |
    | `100`        | 4                                 |
    | `011`        | 3                                 |
    | `010`        | 2                                 |
    | `001`        | 1                                 |
    | `000`        | 0 (LSB)                           |

So, for example, Rule 30 is `00011110` in binary.
*   `111 -> 0`
*   `110 -> 0`
*   `101 -> 0`
*   `100 -> 1`
*   `011 -> 1`
*   `010 -> 1`
*   `001 -> 1`
*   `000 -> 0`

**2. Observation: Odd vs. Even Rules and Behavioral Classes:**

This is a very sharp observation! Let's test it against the categories we've discussed and the underlying meaning of odd/even rule numbers.

*   **An ODD rule number means its Least Significant Bit (LSB) is 1.** In the Wolfram convention, the LSB (bit 0) corresponds to the outcome for the neighborhood `000`. So, **all ODD rules have the property `000 -> 1`**. This means a region of all zeros will spontaneously produce a '1' in its center.
*   **An EVEN rule number means its LSB is 0.** Thus, **all EVEN rules have the property `000 -> 0`**. This means a region of all zeros will remain all zeros (it's a quiescent background).

Now let's look at your observed patterns:

*   **"Super Separator rules (...) all can't be / 2 with whole number like result" (i.e., ODD rules):**
    *   Let's check some of our identified "Super Separators": 5, 13, 27, 79, 85, 89, 91, 97, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121, 127, 129, 133, 137, 139, 141, 145, 153, 157, 163, 167, 169, 173, 177, 179, 181.
    *   And from the complex CAs that also acted as super separators: 105, 106 (counterexample!), 141.
    *   **Observation:** You are largely correct! The vast majority of these are ODD. Rule 106 is an even rule that was a "Super Separator."
    *   **Possible Reason:** The `000 -> 1` property of odd rules might contribute to the "solidifying" or "block-forming" behavior. If the QW feedback creates regions of `0`s adjacent to existing `1`s, the `000 -> 1` sub-rule could help fill in gaps or expand the blocks of `1`s, making them more robust barriers. This is speculative but plausible. The feedback creating `0`s (by flipping `1`s) in regions of high walker probability could frequently lead to `000` neighborhoods at the edges of these clearings, which then turn back to `1`.

*   **"Complex CA / Highly Dynamic Barriers & `<x>` (...) all group can be divided by 2 with whole number like result" (i.e., EVEN rules):**
    *   Let's check some from this category: 22, 30, 45 (odd!), 51 (odd!), 54, 60, 104, 108, 110, 122, 126, 130, 138, 142, 146, 151 (odd!), 152, 161 (odd!), 162, 165 (odd!), 172, 178, 180, 182.
    *   **Observation:** Many are indeed EVEN. The property `000 -> 0` is crucial for many classically studied complex CAs (like Rule 110, Conway's Game of Life) because it allows for a stable, quiescent background against which complex structures (gliders, etc.) can exist and propagate without the background constantly "boiling" with activity. So, it's not surprising that many complex CAs are even.
    *   **Counterexamples:** Rules 45, 51, 151, 161, 165 are odd but still produced complex/dynamic barrier behavior in your system. This means while `000 -> 0` helps complexity, it's not the *only* way to get it, especially with feedback.

**3. Is the Method Generating Rules Reason for This?**

*   **Yes, indirectly.** The "method" is the Wolfram encoding. The odd/even property directly relates to one specific sub-rule: the outcome of the `000` neighborhood.
*   This single sub-rule (`000 -> 0` or `000 -> 1`) has a significant impact on the general character of a CA's evolution:
    *   `000 -> 0` (even rules): Allows for stable backgrounds, often a prerequisite for gliders and other complex persistent structures. The system doesn't create something from nothing in empty space.
    *   `000 -> 1` (odd rules): The CA is inherently "creative" in empty space. This can lead to rapid filling, or, with feedback, perhaps contribute to the solidification of barriers.
*   **However, it's not the *only* factor.** The other 7 bits of the rule are critically important. For example, Rule 110 (even) is complex, but Rule 0 (even, `00000000`) is trivial (always produces 0). Rule 105 (odd) is complex, but Rule 255 (odd, `11111111`) is also trivial (always produces 1).
*   **The Feedback Loop is Key:** Your QW feedback mechanism is a major influence. It constantly perturbs the CA, potentially pushing even rules that might be simple in isolation into more complex regimes, or altering how the `000 -> 1` or `000 -> 0` sub-rule manifests.

**4. Can We Talk About Emergent Properties from These Rules?**

**Absolutely, yes! This is the core of what your exploration is demonstrating.**

**Emergence** refers to the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems. These emergent properties are typically not trivially predictable from the microscopic rules alone but arise from the collective interactions of many components.

In your system, the emergent properties are abundant:

*   **The Distinct Behavioral Classes Themselves:** The fact that you can categorize rules into "Sparse," "Super Separators," "Complex/Dynamic Barriers," "Ordered/Permeable," and "Generic Dynamic" is a clear sign of emergence. These are macroscopic classifications of behavior arising from simple local rules + QW + feedback.
*   **Specific CA Structures:**
    *   The formation of stable, solid blocks by the "Super Separator" rules.
    *   The sparse, mostly empty fields for "Sparse CA" rules.
    *   The dynamic, evolving, sometimes chaotic or intricate patterns for "Complex CA" rules (e.g., Rule 30, 110).
    *   The regular, geometric patterns for "Ordered CA" rules (e.g., Rule 90, 150).
    These are all emergent spatial structures.
*   **Specific Quantum Walker Dynamics:**
    *   **Strong Confinement/Separation:** The way walkers are pushed to opposite ends by "Super Separator" CAs.
    *   **Self-Propulsion/Self-Confinement (Single Walker):** How a single walker can be consistently pushed in one direction by the CA it creates.
    *   **"Turbulent" or Highly Fluctuating Average Positions/Distances:** The walker(s) navigating complex or chaotic CA landscapes (e.g., with Rule 110 or 126).
    *   **Regularized Oscillations in Average Position/Distance:** When interacting with "Ordered CA" rules.
    *   **Relatively Free Spreading:** With "Sparse CA" rules.
*   **The Walker-CA Co-evolution Itself:** The CA shapes the QW's evolution (by changing coin operators), and the QW shapes the CA's evolution (through feedback). This continuous interplay leads to a co-evolutionary process where the final state or behavior of neither subsystem can be easily predicted without considering the other. The system settles into, or explores, different attractors or behavioral regimes.
*   **Robustness of Classes:** The surprising consistency of behavior within some of these classes (e.g., the large number of "Super Separators" that produce very similar walker separation dynamics) is an emergent property. It suggests there are underlying principles governed by certain combinations of sub-rules (like the `000` outcome) that robustly lead to these macroscopic states when coupled with the QW and feedback.

Your observation about the odd/even rule numbers is a great starting point for digging deeper into *why* certain classes emerge. While it's not a perfect predictor, the strong correlation, especially for "Super Separators" (mostly odd) and many "Complex CAs" (often even), points to the significance of the `000` neighborhood's output in shaping the fundamental character of the CA's interaction with the QW and feedback.

This entire study is a beautiful demonstration of how simple local rules and interactions can lead to a stunning diversity of complex, emergent global behaviors.
