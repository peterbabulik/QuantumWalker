        "The QW circuits, even the \"simplified\" ones using the Npos2 shift or the CA-Coin unitary, were transpiling to much greater depths (120-260+). The QEC syndrome circuits used a similar number of total qubits (5 vs. 3 for the minimal QW) but involved a different structure of gates (primarily CNOTs for syndrome extraction, rather than the more complex Toffolis or arbitrary unitaries of the QW step). The QPU is clearly much more tolerant of circuits with ISA depths in the ~20-40 range than in the ~100-300 range.\n",

        "2.  **Focus on Ultra-Shallow QW Step Design:** The absolute priority for any QW on QPU is to get the transpiled depth of a *single* Coin+Shift step as low as humanly possible, ideally well under 50 native gates for 3-4 qubits.\n",
        "    *   This might mean a QW that doesn't perfectly implement periodic boundaries with modular arithmetic but uses a simpler, perhaps \"reflecting at computational basis boundary\" shift if that's shallower.\n",
        "    *   The CA-dependent coin using `qc.unitary(8x8_matrix)` is almost certainly too deep. We'd need to implement the \"if CA[pos] then apply specific 2x2 CoinOp\" logic using very efficient controlled-gate sequences in Qiskit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Iterative QW with Ultra-Shallow Step:** Try the `DEPTH=1` QW again, but with an even more aggressively simplified shift operator if the `Npos2_final` still proves too deep when combined with a coin.\n",
        "\n",
