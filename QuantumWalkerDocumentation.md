## Theoretical Framework

### Key Concepts and Principles

The QuantumWalker project explores a theoretical framework proposing that reality is fundamentally composed of quantized information, processed by underlying quantum algorithms. The core principles include:

1. **Quantized Information**: Information is discrete and fundamental, with the qubit as the basic unit. This implies:
   - **Discreteness**: Reality has a smallest scale at which information is encoded
   - **Quantum Nature**: Information inherently possesses quantum properties like superposition and entanglement
   - **Minimal Information Unit**: The state of a fundamental "cell" is described by a finite amount of quantum information

2. **Algorithmic Geometry**: The "geometrical shape" of observed physical phenomena is a direct manifestation of the "shape" or structure of underlying quantum algorithms. This includes:
   - **Algorithm as Law**: Specific rules governing how information units update and influence each other
   - **Information as State**: The collective informational state of all constituent units
   - **Emergent Geometry**: The connectivity, patterns, distributions, and correlations that arise from the algorithm's execution

3. **Emergent Phenomena**: Entities we perceive as particles, fields, and interactions are emergent properties or stable patterns within the evolving information state, generated by the underlying quantum algorithm.

4. **Quantum-to-Classical Transition**: The transition from wave-like quantum behavior to particle-like classical behavior can be understood as a change in the effective quantum algorithm or a significant event within the algorithm's execution.

### Quantum Walks and Cellular Automata

The project uses Quantum Walks (QWs) and Cellular Automata (CAs) as computational models to explore these theoretical propositions:

1. **Quantum Walks (QWs)**:
   - A quantum mechanical analogue of classical random walks
   - A "walker" (quantum particle) moves on a discrete lattice according to quantum rules
   - The walker's movement is determined by an internal quantum degree of freedom called the "coin"
   - QWs exhibit quantum interference, superposition, and entanglement
   - QWs spread ballistically (σ ∝ t) rather than diffusively (σ ∝ √t)

2. **Cellular Automata (CAs)**:
   - Discrete models consisting of a grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states
   - Cell states evolve according to fixed rules based on neighboring cells
   - Classical CAs (like Rule 30, Rule 90, Rule 110) can generate complex patterns from simple rules
   - Rule 110 is known to be Turing complete (capable of universal computation)

3. **Quantum Walks on CA Substrates**:
   - QWs can be coupled with CAs to create more complex dynamics
   - The CA pattern serves as a structured "environment" or "computational substrate"
   - The QW's coin operation can be made dependent on the CA cell state
   - This creates a two-way coupling where the QW influences the CA and vice versa

### Information-Theoretic Perspective

The project also explores information-theoretic aspects of quantum systems:

1. **Entanglement Entropy**:
   - Measures the quantum correlation between different parts of a system
   - In QWs, entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom quantifies the "quantumness" of the walk
   - The growth and evolution of entanglement provide insights into the system's quantum nature

2. **Algorithmic Complexity**:
   - The compressibility of CA patterns serves as a proxy for algorithmic complexity
   - Different CA rules generate patterns with different levels of complexity
   - The relationship between quantum and classical information measures reveals insights about the nature of information processing

## Quantum Processor Experiments

### Overview of QPU Experiments

The QuantumWalker project includes experiments on real quantum processors (QPUs) to test quantum walk algorithms and related quantum circuits. These experiments serve several purposes:

1. **Validate Theoretical Concepts**: Test whether the quantum behaviors predicted by theory can be observed on real quantum hardware
2. **Assess Hardware Capabilities**: Evaluate the performance of current QPUs for implementing quantum walks
3. **Identify Limitations**: Understand the challenges and constraints of running quantum algorithms on NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices
4. **Bridge Theory and Practice**: Connect theoretical models with practical implementations

The main QPU experiments were conducted on:
- **IBM Brisbane**: 127-qubit Eagle r3 processor
- **IBM Heron**: Another IBM quantum processor with different architecture

### Case Studies and Results

#### 1. Initial QW Attempts & Circuit Depth Challenges

Initial attempts to run even simple 1D Quantum Walk algorithms on IBM QPUs faced significant challenges:

- **QW with QFT-Based Shift** (N=4, D=2 steps):
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: ~216
  - QPU Result: `{'000': 4096}` (all measurements yielded the ground state)

- **QW with CA-Dependent Coin & Manual Shift** (N=4, D=1 step):
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: ~244
  - QPU Result: `{'000': 4096}`

These results indicated that the transpiled circuit depths were too high for the coherence capabilities of the QPU, leading to complete decoherence before measurement.

#### 2. Diagnostic QPU Tests (Shallow Circuits)

To isolate the problem, several shallow circuits were executed:

- **Test A: Initial State Preparation & Measurement**:
  - Circuit: Prepare 3 qubits in state `|010⟩`
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: 2
  - QPU Result: Predominantly `010` (~81.3%), with other outcomes due to SPAM error
  - Conclusion: Successful preparation and measurement of a non-ground state

- **Test B: Hadamard on Coin**:
  - Circuit: Prepare `|010⟩`, apply `H` to coin qubit, measure
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: 5
  - QPU Result: `"010"` (~40.67%) and `"110"` (~40.00%), as expected
  - Conclusion: Successful creation of superposition

- **Test C: Toffoli Gate (CCX)**:
  - Circuit: Prepare `|110⟩`, apply `CCX(q2, q1, q0)`, measure
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: 41
  - QPU Result: `"111"` (~91.14%)
  - Conclusion: Successful operation of Toffoli gate with high fidelity

#### 3. Refined 1D Quantum Walk Attempts

Based on diagnostic successes, QW circuits were redesigned for minimal depth:

- **QW with "Ultra-Simplified Shift"** (N=4, D=1 step):
  - Shift Logic: Coin-conditional single X-gate on position qubit
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: 15
  - QPU Result: `{'000': 4096}`
  - Interpretation: Still problematic despite shallow depth

- **QW with "Manual Npos2 Shift"** (N=4, D=2 steps):
  - Shift Logic: Correctly implements controlled modular increment/decrement
  - Transpiled ISA Depth: 260
  - QPU Result: Distributed across multiple states with qualitatively correct peaks
  - Conclusion: Partial success! Despite high noise, the QPU produced a distribution with the correct dominant peaks

### Comparison with Simulations

The QPU experiments revealed significant differences between ideal simulations and real quantum hardware:

1. **Circuit Depth Impact**:
   - **Simulators**: Can handle arbitrary circuit depths with perfect fidelity
   - **QPUs**: Performance degrades rapidly with increasing circuit depth due to decoherence and gate errors

2. **Noise Effects**:
   - **Simulators**: Typically assume perfect operations unless noise models are explicitly added
   - **QPUs**: Inherently noisy, with various error sources (readout errors, gate errors, decoherence)

3. **Observable Quantum Phenomena**:
   - **Simulators**: Can observe all quantum effects predicted by theory
   - **QPUs**: Can demonstrate basic quantum effects (superposition, entanglement) in shallow circuits, but struggle with more complex quantum dynamics

4. **Scalability**:
   - **Simulators**: Limited by classical computing resources (memory, processing power)
   - **QPUs**: Limited by qubit count, coherence times, and gate fidelities

### Current Limitations and Future Directions

The QPU experiments highlighted several limitations of current quantum hardware for implementing quantum walks:

1. **Circuit Depth Threshold**: There is a clear threshold in transpiled ISA circuit depth beyond which the QPU struggles to maintain quantum coherence. For 3-qubit QW systems, circuits with ISA depths < ~50 performed well, while those with depths > ~100-200 were severely affected.

2. **SPAM Errors**: State Preparation And Measurement errors contribute significantly to the overall error rate, even in shallow circuits.

3. **Complex Operations**: Operations like QFT-based shifts or CA-dependent coin unitaries result in very deep circuits when transpiled to the QPU's native gate set.

4. **Noise Accumulation**: Errors accumulate rapidly with circuit depth, often leading to complete decoherence for deep circuits.

Despite these limitations, the experiments showed promising directions for future work:

1. **Algorithm Optimization**: Redesigning quantum algorithms to minimize circuit depth and gate count for NISQ devices.

2. **Error Mitigation**: Implementing error mitigation techniques to improve the quality of results from noisy quantum hardware.

3. **Hardware Improvements**: As quantum hardware continues to improve (better coherence times, lower gate errors), more complex quantum walks will become feasible.

4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining classical and quantum processing to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.

5. **Quantum Error Correction**: In the longer term, quantum error correction will enable more reliable execution of deep quantum circuits.

The QuantumWalker project demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of implementing quantum walks on real quantum hardware. While current QPUs can successfully execute basic quantum operations and simplified quantum walks, more complex quantum dynamics require further advances in quantum hardware and algorithm design.
