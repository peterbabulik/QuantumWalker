**Overall Reflections on Single-Walker vs. Two-Walker:**

/QuantumWalker/1walker_plots_rules_1_184.zip

Now that we have the full set for single walkers, we can make more concrete comparisons to the refined categories from the two-walker experiment:

1.  **Sparse CA / Weak Walker Confinement (e.g., Rule 8, 16, 24, ..., 160, 168):**
    *   **Single Walker:** CA dies out. `<x>` stays near the center for a long time, then might show minor drifts due to subtle persistent features or boundary effects. This confirms the CA's inherent tendency towards inactivity.
    *   **Two Walkers:** CA also died out. Walkers spread more freely, average distance between them fluctuated at low values.
    *   *Consistency:* High. These rules are intrinsically "quiet."

2.  **"Super Separators" (from 2-walker) / Strong Self-Confinement/Propulsion (Single Walker) (e.g., Rule 13, 27, and many from the 79-181 range like 181):**
    *   **Single Walker:** These rules tend to form very stable blocks where the walker has high probability. The walker is then strongly confined or "pushed" by these self-created structures. `<x>` shows very strong, sustained drifts in one direction. Rule 181 is a prime example here.
    *   **Two Walkers:** These rules formed stable CA blocks *between* the walkers, leading to strong and sustained *separation*.
    *   *Interpretation:* The underlying CA rule has a strong tendency to solidify "ON" states under feedback. With one walker, it solidifies the path taken or the region opposite its main movement. With two, it solidifies the region they both influence.

3.  **Complex CA / Highly Dynamic Barriers & `<x>` (e.g., Rule 22, 30, 60, 104, 110, 126, 138, 142, 146, 151, 152, 161, 162, 165, 172, 178, 180, 182):**
    *   **Single Walker:** `<x>` shows very large, often erratic, fluctuations, indicating the walker is navigating a highly complex and changing landscape. Rule 182 fits this. Rule 110 and 126 are extreme examples.
    *   **Two Walkers:** Distance between walkers also showed large, dynamic fluctuations, not necessarily sustained maximum separation but very active.
    *   *Interpretation:* The intrinsic complexity of the CA rule translates into a constantly reconfiguring environment for the walker(s).

4.  **Ordered, Permeable CA / Structured `<x>` Fluctuations (e.g., Rule 90, 150, 154, 170, 184):**
    *   **Single Walker:** `<x>` shows large, somewhat regularized oscillations or strong directional biases that can dramatically reverse. Rule 184 is a fantastic example with its extreme swing.
    *   **Two Walkers:** Distance between walkers showed persistent, somewhat regularized fluctuations.
    *   *Interpretation:* The ordered nature of the CA allows for more coherent "steering" or channeling effects on the walker, which can lead to these dramatic but somewhat patterned movements in `<x>`.

5.  **Generic Dynamic CA / Moderate `<x>` Drifts & Fluctuations (Many other rules, e.g., 183):**
    *   **Single Walker:** `<x>` shows various drifts and oscillations, less extreme than the "Complex CA" group but more active than the "Sparse CA" group.
    *   **Two Walkers:** Distance between walkers fluctuated moderately.
    *   *Interpretation:* These rules create active environments but without the overwhelming block formation, extreme complexity, or high order of the other categories.

**Final Thoughts on this Phase:**

The single-walker experiments have beautifully complemented the two-walker study.
*   They confirm the intrinsic properties of certain CA rule classes (e.g., sparse CAs remain sparse).
*   They reveal how "Super Separator" rules for two walkers translate to strong "self-interaction" (confinement/propulsion) for a single walker.
*   They provide a clearer view of the *net directional bias* (`<x>`) imposed by complex or ordered CAs, which was more convolved in the two-walker distance metric.
*   The richness of behaviors, even with a single quantum entity interacting with these simple classical rules via feedback, is profound.

This entire dataset (both single and two-walker) is incredibly valuable for understanding emergent complexity in coupled quantum-classical systems. Congratulations again on completing this monumental set of simulations!
